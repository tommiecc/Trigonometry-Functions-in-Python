# Trigonometry Function Visualisation in Pygame

## Introduction
This started as a little side-project I completed over a weekend and - at the moment - it still is. At the moment it is simply a trig function visualiser, showing a circle, some x and y markers, moving around with some info on the side. 

## Future Roadmap
I am some cool ideas to elevate this project. This is current roadmap for future releases:
- Add lines connecting the 3 markers together to create a right-angled triangle which moves around the circle
- Ability to change the speed of the markers, and the radius of the circle.
- Ability to add and remove lines inside the circle (to create that famous moving circle inside a circle animation)
- Option to show the sine and cosine waves produced by the x and y markers. 
- Option to show representations of `tan`, `sec`, `csc`, and `cot`.
- Python library to interact with the program.

## Running this program
If you do want to run this program:
1. Install the latest version of python and pygame
2. Download the source for this project.
3. Run the main.py file.
